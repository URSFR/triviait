# Trivia IT - Trivia with Firebase includes Filter

THIS IS A OPEN SOURCE ECOMMERCE MADE BY ME (Rodrigo), YOU CAN USE THIS FOR FREE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO GIVE CREDITS, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IT BY REDIRECTING TO THIS GITHUB.\
It was tested on Web and Android, but must work in any platform

## Getting Started

In order to use this project, you must have a Firebase account and open a Firestore Database (it works in the free version).\

### Step 1

Create a .env file in the same directory as the .env.example

### Step 2

Copy the contents of the .env.example into the .env file and fill in the variables

### Step 3

run in the terminal in the following order:\
flutter clean\
flutter pub get\
dart run build_runner build

### Step 4

Enjoy :)\

# WEB MUST READ

if you use Web must enter in the index.html and fill in the firebase script with all the contents of the .env file\



I do not provide any type of support when referring to open source but in case of errors in my free time I can solve them\
